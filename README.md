## Custom Wordle Project with Vite and React

This project is a custom Wordle game built using Vite and React. It allows users to create their own word guessing challenges with unique words and difficulty levels.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

### Getting Started

2.  Clone the repository:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/joannahosking/wordle-builder.git
    ```
    
4.  Install dependencies:
    
    ```
    cd wordle-builder
    npm install
    ```
    

### Development Server

2.  Start the development server:
    
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    This will open the development server in your default browser, usually at http://localhost:5173/.
    

### Build for Production

2.  Build the project for production:
    
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
    
    This will create a production-ready build in the `dist` folder.
    

### Additional Notes

-   This project uses the default Vite configuration with a React template.
-   Feel free to customise the project further and add new features as needed. Contributions are welcome!
